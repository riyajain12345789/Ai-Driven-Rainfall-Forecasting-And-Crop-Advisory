This project given an intelligent weather prediction for sustainable agriculture, and Transforming agriculture with predictive AI to enhance crop resilience and yield. 
Farming depends a lot on rainfall , and changes in rainfall can cause big crop losses and money problems for farmers . 
The weather forecasts we have earlier are often not accurate enough or do not predict far enough into the future to help farmers plan properly. 
So , there was a need to make this project , so that we can get accurate, location-based, and crop-specific rainfall forecasts.
